# ESP_Home_for_Home_Assistant
Yaml files for ESP microcontrolers used with Home Assistant. There is code for devices like; Adafruit Feather, Eco Plug, Lilygo T-Display-S3 + Touch, Lilygo T-HMI

If you have a device with a TFT then you will need to copy the images folder to your home assistant's config/esphome/ folder.

If you have a Lilygo T-Display-S3, including the touch version, you will need to copy the lilygo-tdisplay-esphome folder into your home assistant's config/esphome/ folder.

If you have a Lilygo T-HMI, copy the folder lilygo-thmis3-esphome to your home assistant's config/esphome/ folder.

If you are trying the higrow or plug examples then you shouldn't need anything extra.
